# Overview

Many public wi-fi hotspots require that you first open a webpage to agree to their terms and conditions. This program will accept those terms and conditions for you so you don't have to open a browser window and accept them yourself.

Note: This program makes certain assumptions about the wi-fi hotspot and is not guaranteed to work in all locations.

Run it from the command line:

    java com.mangst.wifi.PublicWifiAccepter --verbose

# Command line arguments

    --verbose, -v
       Displays progress messages as the program runs.
    --help, -h
       Displays this help text.
